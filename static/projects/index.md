I donate time to open source and am setup to [receive
donations](https://github.com/sponsors/philderbeast).

I'm pushing for units of measure and functional programming. F# has units built
in. I have contributed to adding units to Haskell via type checker plugins.

To try out new and interesting programming languages, I've been adding geodetic
library packages for F#, Haskell, Koka. Oftentimes this uncovers problems with
the compilers.

I'll take the time to report issues and contribute patches to compilers and
tools I use. I've reported issues with
[ghc](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues?scope=all&state=all&author_username=philderbeast),
[unison](https://github.com/unisonweb/unison/issues/created_by/philderbeast) and
[koka](https://github.com/koka-lang/koka/issues/created_by/philderbeast). I
first contributed to GHC when they were using phrabricator. It was quite the
process to get started. Much easier now. Here's my first contribution to GHC:

* For the newcomer labelled bug
[12441](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/issues/12441), fix pretty printing
for [explicit
quantifiers](https://github.com/ghc/ghc/commit/33140f41b931fb81bf2e5aa28603fe757bb3779d).

I'll use front end frameworks that change the paradigm or bring more type
checking to redo a portion of nose cone and get a feel for how they work in
practice that way.
