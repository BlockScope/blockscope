I donate time to open source and am setup to [receive
donations](https://github.com/sponsors/philderbeast) (not that anybody has - yet).

I'm pushing for [units of measure](/projects/uom) and functional programming.
F# has units built in. We can have units in Haskell with type checker plugins.

I've solved [geodetics](/projects/geodetics) problems in a variety of programming
languages.

Here's my first contribution to `GHC`, the Glasgow Haskell Compiler:

* For the newcomer labelled bug
[12441](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/issues/12441), fix pretty printing
for [explicit
quantifiers](https://github.com/ghc/ghc/commit/33140f41b931fb81bf2e5aa28603fe757bb3779d).
