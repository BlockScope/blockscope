title: 'Units of Measure'
subtitle: We're not comparing apples and oranges, are we?
---
I've been quite interested in units of measure in programming languages since I
worked on a 3-year project to commercialise a potato crop model. The model was
in NZ customary units; kgs, hectares and litres. We stored the data in SI units
but we also had to display in the user's choice of units, such as acre and
gallon and even some unusual units such as hundredweight. We used the [unified code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Code_for_Units_of_Measure) for units of measure as XML.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ascii"?>
<root>
   <prefix Code="k" CODE="K">
      <name>kilo</name>
      <printSymbol>k</printSymbol>
      <value value="1e3">1 &#215; 10<sup>3</sup>
      </value>
   </prefix>
   ...
   <base-unit Code="m" CODE="M" dim="L">
      <name>meter</name>
      <printSymbol>m</printSymbol>
      <property>length</property>
   </base-unit>
   <base-unit Code="s" CODE="S" dim="T">
      <name>second</name>
      <printSymbol>s</printSymbol>
      <property>time</property>
   </base-unit>
   <base-unit Code="g" CODE="G" dim="M">
      <name>gram</name>
      <printSymbol>g</printSymbol>
      <property>mass</property>
   </base-unit>
   ...
   <unit Code="Hz" CODE="HZ" isMetric="yes" class="si">
      <name>Herz</name>
      <printSymbol>Hz</printSymbol>
      <property>frequency</property>
      <value Unit="s-1" UNIT="S-1" value="1">1</value>
   </unit>
   <unit Code="N" CODE="N" isMetric="yes" class="si">
      <name>Newton</name>
      <printSymbol>N</printSymbol>
      <property>force</property>
      <value Unit="kg.m/s2" UNIT="KG.M/S2" value="1">1</value>
   </unit>
```

In C# we parsed this and added some conversion functions. There has to be a
better way, right? Well there is. F# has units of measure built in. They typed
checked and erased. I've contributed to type checker plugins that help GHC, the
Haskell compiler, with units of measure.

[Bump](https://github.com/adamgundry/units-parser/commit/9db2652bfbeea5d69f590ce15c171d7b9801bb60)
expected test output for later ghc versions.
* `adamgundry`[**/uom-plugin**](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/uom-plugin)  
A compiler plugin for units of measure that
I [contribute](https://github.com/adamgundry/uom-plugin/graphs/contributors)
to and use in flare-timing.
* `bgamari`[**/the-thoralf-plugin**](https://cs.brynmawr.edu/~rae/papers/2018/thoralf/thoralf.pdf)  
After seeing a presentation on this compiler plugin at the Haskell symposium
2018,
I [fixed](https://github.com/bgamari/the-thoralf-plugin/commits?author=philderbeast)
some build warnings and got it compiling with ghc-8.6.1.

    This is an attempt to refactor the [thoralf-plugin][thoralf-plugin] and the
    [uom-plugin][uom-plugin]. Under the hood, the `thoralf-plugin` uses Z3 to solve
    equational theories. The `uom-plugin` solves trivial equations, rewrites and
    simplifies constraints and makes substitutions.

    [slug]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slug_(unit)
    [uom-plugin]: https://github.com/adamgundry/uom-plugin
    [thoralf-plugin]: https://github.com/bgamari/the-thoralf-plugin
    [ghc-tcplugins-extra]: https://github.com/BlockScope/ghc-tcplugins-extra
    [units-parser]: https://github.com/adamgundry/units-parser

    The `uom-plugin` depends on [ghc-tcplugins-extra][ghc-tcplugins-extra] and
    [units-parser][units-parser]. It defines a quasiquoter for writing units with
    measures, such as `[u| 9.8 m/s^2 |]`.

    The `thoralf-plugin` ships with one small units example, calculating distance
    in `m` from velocity in `m/s` and time in `s`. The `uom-plugin` has a large
    number of unit tests.

    <h5>*Goals*</h5>
    * Use the unit quasiquoter with the `thoralf-plugin` and get it to pass all of
      the units tests of the `uom-plugin`.
    * Identify, refactor and extract commonality in both unit plugins.

    <h5 style="margin-top: 1em">*Progress*</h5>
    * Added `ghc-corroborate`, a new package exposing a flattened subset of GHC's
      API needed for typechecking plugins as a single API across multiple GHC
      versions. It uses cabal conditionals and mixins and avoids use of the `CPP`
      language extension and predefined macros for switching between GHC versions.
    * Forked `ghc-tcplugins-extra` to use `ghc-corroborate` and to remove its use
      of `CPP`.
    * Moved the tracing of the `thoralf-plugin` to `ghc-tcplugins-trace`.
    * Moved the quasiquoter of the `uom-plugin` to `uom-th`.
    * Moved the units of measure (UoM) theory from the `thoralf-plugin` and much of
      the `uom-plugin` internals to `uom-quantity`.
    * Pulled unit definitions out of `uom-plugin` and put these into
      `uom-plugin-defs`.
    * Rearranged the modules of each plugin for similarity between both.
