I help managers, technicians, scientists and developers build quality software.

## Services
* Writing up and posing problems, investigating and proposing solutions.
* Assessing, prototyping and recommending tech stacks.
* Setting up development environments, automating builds and deployments.
* Contributing fixes, raising, commenting on and triaging issues.
* Testing what works now and discovering new failures.
* Mentoring, coaching and training.

I'm happy doing first commits and untangling knotty codebases.
