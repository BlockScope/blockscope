When you're a worker with a wage or a salaried employee there will be labour
laws and union rules that cover the engagement between you and the employer. How
much will you get paid? When are you required to work? What holidays do you get
and how much sickness is covered?

When contracting, the main negotiation may be around the rate of payment for
services but there are other things to consider too, like obligations and
termination in the event of sickness and for a longer contract, how to take time
off.

I've worked as a contracting software developer since 1999, almost always
offsite but usually not far from the client so that I can drop in to visit for
meetings from time to time. I've had the occassional contract that has been
truly remote, where I've not ever met the client in person. With the pandemic
many more people are working remotely and it seems employers are more willing to
hire remotely. Some of these contracts will not be worth taking on because the
conditions or the rate is not good. I've been offered a couple of contracts
where the client intends to hire a contractor as an employee in all but name.

When a client wants to add a contractor to a team of salaried software
developers, how to convert pay rates and conditions from permanent to contractor?

I got offered a contract out of New York in Haskell at $80/hr where senior
permanent dev staff get about $150,000 as base salary. The negotiations fell
through but led me to review rates, especially comparing permanent with
contract.

I found an interesting analysis of the true cost of consultants versus
employees.

For a long time a rule of thumb I've heard of and used myself is, take an annual
salary in thousands and use that as hourly rate for contracting, so $100,000/yr
converts to $100/hr.

Do you think this conversion is fair and fits with what you're seeing out in the
market?
