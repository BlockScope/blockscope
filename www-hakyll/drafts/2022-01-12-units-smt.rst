Tracing Plugins
---------------

To trace a program using the ``uom-plugin`` add the ghc option
``-ddump-tc-trace``. This will produce very detailed logging of typechecking.

.. code:: pre

    tcPluginSolve start uom-simplify-plugin
    wanted  = [[WD] hole{aaGE} {2}:: (One :: Unit)
                                    ~#
                                    ((Base "s" /: Base "s") :: Unit) (CNonCanonical)]
    tcPluginSolve ok uom-simplify-plugin
    solved = [(CO U(plugin:uom-solve, One, Base "s" /: Base "s")_N,
                [WD] hole{aaGE} {2}:: (One :: Unit)
                                    ~#
                                    ((Base "s" /: Base "s") :: Unit) (CNonCanonical))]
    new    = []
