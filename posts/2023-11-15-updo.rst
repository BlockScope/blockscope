Make Projects Fast
==================

`Updo <cabalism-updo_>`_ is **lightweight** tooling for generating Haskell
projects
**fast**.

In the ``make`` way of only doing as much as needed, it takes seconds to
generate projects with a large number of packages and dependencies. It runs
locally. Alternative tools that do project mirroring can take minutes bringing
down repositories of source dependencies but Updo doesn't need to do this
because it has all the needed information at hand in `one configuration`_.

It is low-tech, made up of Makefiles, Dhall text templates and very short
Haskell scripts that can optionally be installed as executables.

You'll still need another tool to actually build the packages in these projects,
tools like `Cabal <cabal-docs_>`_ or `Stack <stack-docs_>`_ or `haskell.nix
<haskell-nix-docs_>`_.

Simple Bootstrapping
====================

Updo expects one entry point, a ``project-files.mk`` (or other named) Makefile.
This short file includes a recipe to bootstrap Updo, adding it to your project
from hackage or its own source repository. Distributing Updo as a Haskell
package makes this easy.

    .. code-block:: Makefile

        # project-files.mk
        UPDO_VERSION ?= 1.0.0
        HACKAGE := http://hackage.haskell.org/package
        UPDO_URL := ${HACKAGE}/updo-${UPDO_VERSION}/updo-${UPDO_VERSION}.tar.gz

        updo/Makefile:
            rm -rf updo
            curl -sSL ${UPDO_URL} | tar -xz
            mv updo-* updo
            chmod +x $$(grep -RIl '^#!' updo)

We recommend to ``.gitignore`` its ``updo`` folder for itself and its ``.updo``
working folder.

One Configuration
=================

One set of configuration is used for all project types.  You can use Updo to
exclusively generate Cabal projects or exclusively generate Stack projects or do
both at the same time. It can also generate a sha256map_ for safely grabbing
packages from source repositories with haskell.nix.  Different Makefile targets
say what to generate. For the default ``.PHONY all`` rule in examples, we build
everything for the current project but nothing else.  You're free to do whatever
you want with your entry Makefile.

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ make -f project-files.mk cabal.project
        $ make -f project-files.mk stack.yaml
        $ make -f project-files.mk

.. note::

    When did Stack and Cabal get projects and what is the default project file name
    of each?

    * In May 2015[#]_ `commercialhaskell/stack <stack-proj_>`_ added ``stack.yaml``
    * In Apr 2016[#]_ `haskell/cabal <cabal-proj_>`_ added ``cabal.project``

    A project is a file, typically but not necessarily, placed at the root of 
    directory tree of packages[#]_. Any file name you like can be used as
    project by these tools, located anywhere with a ``--stack-yaml`` or
    ``--project-file`` option but if not at the root then care must be taken to
    use relative paths to local packages of the project.

    Haskell.nix can use either kind of project file.

.. [#] Use these commands to view the history of stack's default project file:

    .. code-block:: pre

        $ git log -p -- stack.yaml
        $ git log -p -- stack.config
        $ git log -p -- stackage.config

.. [#] Use these commands to view the history of cabal's default project file:

    .. code-block:: pre

        $ git log -p -- cabal.project

.. [#] A common pattern for stack projects is to have a default ``stack.yaml``
    project in the root and then other projects for each compiler version that
    the project is tested against, either also in the root or in a folder. These
    will then be named by resolver or GHC version, e.g.
    ``./stack/stack-8.6.5.yaml``.

Projects are versioned by their stackage package set resolver and matching GHC
compiler version, first specified in ``project-versions.mk`` and then followed
up in STACKAGE-versioned files and GHC-versioned folders for setup
configuration.

    .. code-block:: makefile

        # Versions of GHC and stackage resolver, the ones we're on and the next
        # ones we're upgrading to.
        GHC_VERSION ?= 9.2.7
        STACKAGE_VERSION ?= lts-20.23

        # For the upgrade, pick a matching pair of ghc-version and stack
        # resolver.
        GHC_UPGRADE ?= 9.4.5
        STACKAGE_UPGRADE ?= lts-21.4

.. note::

    We put version ``make`` variable assignments in ``project-versions.mk``.
    These variables have to be set but how you do that is up to you.

        .. code-block:: Makefile

            # project-files.mk
            include project-versions.mk
            include updo/Makefile

For the set up, we specify paths to local packages, version constraints for
external published packages and source repository commits for forked or
unpublished packages. Other free-form configuration in snippets can be injected
into the generated projects too so all configuration options are possible. The
Dhall text templates can be very simple by calling the default templates we
provide or you can do whatever you want with your templates. Not all
configuration is necessary.  Everything except the text templates can be left
out[#empty]_.

.. [#empty] ``updo-1.0.0`` doesn't use a `default empty list <empty-list-default_>`_
    when a configuration file is missing but that feature is in the works,
    implemented but not yet published.

.. code-block:: pre

To explain the short 3-letter field names in records for:

- constraints
    .. code-block:: dhall

        { dep : Text, ver : Text }

    The **ver**sion is the version equality constraint for a package
    **dep**endency that can include Stack's ``@rev`` syntax for revisions.

- source-repository-packages
    .. code-block:: dhall

        { loc : Text, tag : Text, sub : List Text }

    The **loc**ation is the source repository URL, the **tag** is the git tag or
    branch name and the **sub** is a list of subdirectories to package
    ``.cabal`` files.

Copy That!
==========

Updo is stackage-centric. If you don't want to use stackage, this is probably
not the tool for you but the dependency configuration is flexible enough to use
versions other than those stackage provides in its resolver package sets.

By default, generated Cabal and Stack projects are as close to copies as we can
get but why have two copies?

* Personal Preference
    Enables team members who prefer one build tool over the other to pick one.
* Get to Know Both
    Cabal and Stack have different command phraseologies. Have a project
    ready-to-go for trying out or learning the other tool.
* Pick the Better Tool
    Enables switching when a build feature is better in one tool or missing in
    the other.
* Tool Breakage Fallback
    When something breaks with one tool we have a fallback.

Progressive Upgrades
====================

Updo is also for upgrading projects. By upgrading we usually mean upgrading to a
new version of GHC and a new version of stackage but progressive upgrading can
also be used for upgrading a dependency that has significantly changed or
swapping one dependency for another with a different API.

Updo can work to generate one set of "current" (Cabal and Stack) projects and
one set of "upgrade" projects at a time.

The "current" projects are generated by the default ``.PHONY all`` target. The
active "upgrade" projects are generated by the ``upgrade-projects`` target,
plural because it generates both Cabal and Stack projects. Configuration in
``project-dhall/ghc-x.y.z`` where ``x.y.z /= ${GHC_VERSION|GHC_UPGRADE}`` is
ignored by Updo but "current" and active "upgrade" versions can be changed on
the fly with environment variables.

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ make -f project-files.mk
        $ make -f project-files.mk upgrade-projects
        $ GHC_UPGRADE=9.6.3 STACKAGE_UPGRADE=nightly-2023-11-15 \
            make -f project-files.mk upgrade-projects

Local packages of the active upgrade project can be brought in progressively by
keeping a ``project-dhall/pkgs-upgrade-todo.dhall`` to do list. This is best
done in dependency order. The generated upgrade projects will include packages
not in the to do list. That way we can compile the already upgraded packages
along with packages just added, one or a few at a time for upgrade that may fail
to compile. In the generated project files, the to do list is shown commented
out.

Conventions
===========

Updo is a convention over configuration tool that expects a certain minimal
structure. Aside from the root level ``project-files.mk`` entry point, 
configuration goes into a ``project-dhall/ghc-x.y.z`` folder (it is all
``.dhall`` files). Cabal configuration from stackage will likely need to be
downloaded to a ``project-stackage/${STACKAGE-VERSION}.config`` file so that we
can comment out any conflicting versions in the ``constraints`` field. We can
skip the download and import this configuration directly from stackage when
there are no version conflicts.

Configuration of constraints (dependency package version equalities) and source
repository package dependencies can be kept sorted using editor functionality
because each file is a list of records.  After sorting or editing we recommend
using ``dhall format`` on any ``*.dhall`` file you've touched.

We've split source repository dependencies into a two-by-two matrix of original
**dep**endency or **fork** and **internal** or **external** package. Any of
these configuration files can be omitted if not needed[#empty]_.

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ tree
        ...
        ├── deps-external.dhall
        ├── deps-internal.dhall
        ├── forks-external.dhall
        ├── forks-internal.dhall

Experience Report
=================

Updo grew to fill a need after every other way I could find to maintain projects
was unsatisfactory for the specific problem I had, herding hundreds of packages
and their dependencies into buildable projects over multiple compiler versions
for both Cabal and Stack. The more I use it, the more I love it as a fast,
simple and appropriate solution for maintaining Haskell projects.

You can find examples of Updo conversions at `github/up-do <up-do-examples_>`_ ,
including conversions of `cabal <cabal_>`_ and `stack <stack_>`_.
